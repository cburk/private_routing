Testing Strategy:

Components:

  1. A lot of our component testing was focused on our helper functions.  The most
important of these is send_dv_update, which takes some parameters and sends a fully
formed dv_update message to the specified recipient.  We tested this function and our
code in the ping alert with a simple check on the receiving end that cast the
received message to its type and printed out the components, ensuring they were all
still in the correct order, position, the size was correct, etc.

  The helper function update_all_through (which changes the recorded length
of all paths through a given port on a router by a certain amount) was tested by
comparing the length of paths before the call to lengths after the call.  We would
ensure that only the paths that went through that port were affected.

  To test that the alarms were working properly, after determining which type of
alarm it was, we printed out a message saying the type.  Then we ran a
sufficiently long test and ensured that the alarm messages were printing out
at the proper intervals.

  

System:

  1. Made use of simpletests1-3 and their sample outputs by ensuring that the
outputs were similar to those created by our solution, and by printing out the
routing tables at important moments (i.e. links going up and down, at the beginning
and end) to ensure that the results matched our expectations.
